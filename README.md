- 👋 Hi, I’m Izu
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of different types of software systems, from games and music, to website development, servers to run personal services, scripts and bots etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python with freecodecamp.org
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any hacky DIY type projects, like custom keyboards or software tools to make life easier.
- 📫 You can message me on GitHub, I check it regularly.
